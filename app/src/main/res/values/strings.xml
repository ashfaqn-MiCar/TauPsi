    <string name="rush_description">Rush is a series of events hosted by the fraternity that allow prospective and current members to get to know each other. At the end of rush, the brothers will offer a bid to the men best
        fitted for membership. A bid is an invitation to start the pledge process.
    </string>



    <string name="requirements_description">In order to be considered for a bid, a prospective member must have an overall GPA of 2.5, attend three rush events, and complete a interview. The three rush events must be an informational
        , a social, and a community service. Even though three is the requirement, attending more will achieve a higher chance of getting a bid. The events this semester are listed below.
